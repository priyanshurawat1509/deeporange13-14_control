# Deep Orange DBW Controls Interface Package for Autonomous Driving

### Functionality:

- DeepOrangeDbwCan.cpp: Enable passing the ROS topics to the Raptor DBW controller via SocketCAN, which executes the commands for the platform to move.
- VehicleModel.cpp: Use the vehicle dynamics model to convert vehicle velocity to left and right track velocity/torques.
- DbwSupervisor.cpp: A ROS state machine in sync with the Raptor controller state machine.
- TO DO: A node that Monitor health of sensors hardware and ROS connections to the on-board computer, and publishes health info to DbwSupervisor through `ros_health` topic.
- Implementation - Instantiates the three objects in a single node (as of now).

### How to Use:
- To add/update CAN msg IDs- update these in the dbc in the `dbc` folder as well as `dispatch_can_msgs.h` include file
- Vehicle and subsystem states are enumerated in `states_enum.h`
-
